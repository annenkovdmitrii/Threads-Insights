- **Insights Retrieval**: Fetch user and media insights with support for metrics like `likes`, `views`, `followers_count`, and breakdowns like `country` or `gender`.
- **Thread Fetching**: Retrieve user threads with pagination support and filter by time ranges.
- **DataFrame Conversion**: Convert raw API responses into structured pandas DataFrames.
